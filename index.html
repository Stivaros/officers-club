					<p>The Officers’ Club was born in the summer of 2017, full of optimism ahead of the Rossi Eames reign, 
            by one ardent Barnet FC fan and three sympathisers – all of whom have worked at the club in some capacity. 
            What was spawned following a scorchingly hot pre-season friendly at Maidstone United slowly became an incredibly infrequent podcast, 
            listened to by literally hundreds of people. 
            In fact, there have only just been more episodes than Bees managers in its inaugural season. 
            You can find out more about the presenters and listen to previous shows here.</p>

							<h3>Jonathan Blakie</h3>
							<p>
                is a man who has a glutton for punishment. A long-suffering Sunderland fan by birth, 
                he has signed up for a second life of misery by commentating on, and developing a soft spot for, Barnet FC. 
                Jonathan first arrived at The Hive in 2013 when he stood in for the hugely-popular Karl Bates on 
                Bees Player and it’s his voice you’ve heard on the airwaves virtually ever since. 
                Home, away, come rain or shine, Jonathan has brought you nearly every magical Barnet moment since – 
                most memorably, Shaun Batt’s one Bees goal!

							<h3>Tom Bodell</h3>
							<p>
                is another member of the team who has failed to grasp the concept of an affair properly, 
                trading a life supporting Watford for being a Barnet sympathiser. 
                He attended his first Bees match at Underhill in 2009 when the two teams met in the League Cup. 
                Through a college friend he remained in touch with goings on and, completely by chance, 
                ended up covering the Bees’ third Conference win for the Barnet and Potters Bar Times. 
                In 2016 he succeeded Will as Head of Media and Communications, a role he relinquished in February 2017. 
                He still takes an unhealthy interest in the Bees.

							<h3>Will Evans</h3>
							<p>
                  is the one born-and-bred Barnet supporter of the podcast. 
                  A regular at Underhill from 1996 until 2014, he followed the Bees to The Hive and turned that passion into 
                  profession for the 2015/16 campaign when he became Head of Media and Communications for the club’s first 
                  season back in League Two following promotion. 
                  His intense fear of Martin Allen, coupled with the need to put food on the table, 
                  saw him leave The Hive in a working capacity after a single season. 
                  Even moving to Southend hasn’t been enough to stop him making it to games, though, 
                  and he remains co-commentator to Jonathan Blakie at away games.

                <p>
                  <em>Stathi</em> is host of The Officers’ Club podcast and the technical guru who ensures our top-quality 
                  audio content hits your ears in as many places as possible. 
                  His fall from supporting grace is the most sheer, 
                  trading the comfy life of following Manchester United home and away from his sofa for football’s frontline, 
                  backing the Bees. He worked at The Hive for the longest period – 
                  demonstrating a baffling level of patience in doing so – 
                  working in Foundation, Ticketing &amp; Memberships, Systems &amp; IT and finishing in Control Oversight. 
                  He has his FA Level 1 and 2 coaching badges, too, making him the second-most qualified coach at The Hive.

            This pod started because we love to talk about Barnet FC and thought we'd share the discussion.
            We welcome your thoughts, criticism (abuse to <a href="https://twitter.com/TBBodell">@TBBodell</a>) and questions,
            especially before we record a pod.
